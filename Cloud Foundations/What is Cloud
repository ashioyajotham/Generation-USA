* Cloud computing - on-demand delivery of compute power, database, storage, applications and other IT resources via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing


*********************Cloud Service Models**********************************

## PaaS (Platform as a Service)
 // A service that offers a complete development and deployment in the cloud. The customer manages the application and data on a platform while the service provider
   provides the runtime, middleware, virtualization, OS, servers, storage, networking. You only worry about deploying your app to the end user while evrything else is taken care of
 // Examples of PaaS; Gooogle Cloud Engine, Heroku, Elastic Beanstalk (AWS)
 
 ## SaaS (Software as a Service)
 // Is a way companies deliver applications or software over the internet to the end user.
 // Complete product
// Now with using a SaaS product, everything is already managed for you.
// You do not have to manage anything at all. The service provider manages everything from the application, the data, the runtime, 
   the middleware, the operating system,the virtualization, servers, storage, and networking.
   Examples: Zoom, MailChimp(email marketing service), Dropbox, Slack etc
   
   
## IaaS (Infrasctructure as a Service)
// A form of computing service that provides virtualized computing services over the internet to its users
   Virtualization uses software to create abstract layer over a computer hardwware
// More control over IT resources
// The user is responsible to run the Application, Data, Runtime, middleware, OS while the service provider manages virtualization, servers, storage and networking
// Examples: AWS, Microsoft Azure and GCP


## FaaS (fuinction as a Service)
// A foem of cloud computing service that allows you to execute code in response to events
// The user only manages application while the rest is managed by service provider (Data to Network)
Wxample: Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions, AWS Lambda



#### Server
// A computer or device that provides programmable service to another computer program and its user
  
  Types of Servers
   Database servers
   App servers
   Web Servers
   
   
#### Serverless
// A cloud computing execution model in which the cloud provider allocates machine resources on demand


#### Cloud computing deployment models
  Cloud
  Hybrid
  On-Premises - dedicated reources
