 ## PaaS (Platform as a Service)
 // A service that offers a complete development and deployment in the cloud. The customer manages the application and data on a platform while the service provider
   provides the runtime, middleware, virtualization, OS, servers, storage, networking. You only worry aout deploying your app to the end user while evrything else is taken care of
 // Examples of PaaS; Gooogle Cloud Engine, Heroku, Elastic Beanstalk (AWS)
 
 ## SaaS (Software as a Service)
 // Is a way companies deliver applications or software over the internet to the end user.
// Now with using a SaaS product, everything is already managed for you.
// You do not have to manage anything at all. The service provider manages everything from the application, the data, the runtime, 
   the middleware, the operating system,the virtualization, servers, storage, and networking.
