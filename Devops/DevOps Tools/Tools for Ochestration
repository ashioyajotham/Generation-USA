* Orchestration - automation that supports processes and workflows, such as provisioning resources
* Orchestration allows us to do things like:
    /scale up and down applications
    /auto-scale applications based on usage
    / create self-healing systems by spinning down unhealthy nodes and replacing them with new ones
    
Examples:
  Docker Swarm
  Kubernetes
  Terraform
