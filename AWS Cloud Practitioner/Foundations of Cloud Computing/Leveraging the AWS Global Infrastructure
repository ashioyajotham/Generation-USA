# A region is a physical location
# A region is a collection of AZs
# AWS logically groups its regions into geographical locations.
# When deploying an app you want to deploy it in the nearest geographical locations to improve user experience


##################### Region Charactersistics ##########################
<Fully independent and isolated>
* If one region is impacted, others will not be.

<Resource and Service Specific>
* Regions are isolated and resources aren't automatically replicated across them



#################### Availability Zones (AZs)######################
* Consist of one or more physically separated data centers each with redundant power, networking and connectivity housed in separate facilities eg Ohio (3 AZs)
NOTE: AZs have multiple data centers

### Charcatersistics of AZs
  * Physically separated links
  * Connected through low latency links
  * Allow fault tolerant
  * Allow for high availability - when you distribute across multiple AZs, one zone fails the app still runs (multi-deployment)
  
 
######################## Edge Zones ##############################
* Think of it as a mini data center. They cache content for fast delivery to users through Amazon Cloudfront and Content Delivery Network
* There can be more edge zones than AZs
* Reduced latency
   Latency - amount of time it takes for your website to load
             High latency - bad
             Low latency - good
