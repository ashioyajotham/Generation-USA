Cloud can be servers in a data center
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet
AWS has several compute services like EC2 and Lambda
To maximize the use of their servers, AWS allows you to share their servers through virtualization.
 * Virtualization - divide hardware resources on a single physical server into smaller units referred to as virtual machines
Usage is metered like power companies; on-demand and pay-as-you-ago



               ################## Cloud Computing Models ############################
               
There are  basic models:
 *Saas
 *Paas
 *Iaas
 
 
 ### IaaS
 <Building blocks>
 * Fundamental building blocks that can be rented. 
 Eg: <Web hosting>
 Monthly sub to have your website hosted
 
 
 ### SaaS
  <Complete application>
 * Complete application that someone offers too users
 * 
 
  Eg: <Email provider> 
 * Your personal email you access through a web browser is SaaS
 
 
 ### PaaS
   <Used by Developers>
 * Develop software using web-based tools without worrying about the underlying infrastructure
 
 Eg: <Storefront Website>
 * Tools provided to build a storefront application that runs on another company's server
 
 


              ############# Cloud Deployment Models ##########################
              
 i) Private Cloud / On-premises
 * Internal data center. Internal data center + local network
 * Doesn't offer the advantages of cloud computing
 * Increased level of security and no sharing of resources using virtualization unlike the others.
 
ii) Public Cloud
 * This is AWS
 * You aren't responsible for the physical hardware
 * You also gain increased increased security and virtualization.
 * Massive economies of scale
 
iii) Hybrid Cloud
 * Combo of public + private
 * Higly sensitive data stored locally while web application runs on AWS
 * AWS provides tools so that they can talk to each other through AWS Direct Connect
 
 

############# Benefits of Cloud Computing
* High Availability:
// A high availability system is one that operates continuously without failure. Such systems avoid loss of service by managing failures.

Elasticity: 
//This is where you provision services based on demand. With this, you donâ€™t have to plan ahead of time.

Agility:
// AWS helps you innovate faster giving you speed.

Durability:
// This refers to data protection and AWS gives you long term data protection.
