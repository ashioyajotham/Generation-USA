Cloud can be servers in a data center
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet
AWS has several compute services like EC2 and Lambda
To maximize the use of their servers, AWS allows you to share their servers through virtualization.
 * Virtualization - divide hardware resources on a single physical server into smaller units referred to as virtual machines
Usage is metered like power companies; on-demand and pay-as-you-ago



               ################## Cloud Computing Models ############################
               
There are  basic models:
 *Saas
 *Paas
 *Iaas
 
 
 ### IaaS
 <Building blocks>
 * Fundamental building blocks that can be rented. 
 Eg: <Web hosting>
 Monthly sub to have your website hosted
 
 
 ### SaaS
  <Complete application>
 * Complete application that someone offers too users
 * 
 
  Eg: <Email provider> 
 * Your personal email you access through a web browser is SaaS
 
 
 ### PaaS
   <Used by Developers>
 * Develop software using web-based tools without worrying about the underlying infrastructure
 
 Eg: <Storefront Website>
 * Tools provided to build a storefront application that runs on another company's server
 
 


              ############# Cloud Deployment Models ##########################
              
 i) Private Cloud / On-premises
 * Internal data center. Internal data center + local network
 * Doesn't offer the advantages of cloud computing
 * Increased level of security and no sharing of resources using virtualization unlike the others.
 
ii) Public Cloud
 * This is AWS
 * You aren't responsible for the physical hardware
 * You also gain increased increased security and virtualization.
 * Massive economies of scale
 
iii) Hybrid Cloud
 * Combo of public + private
 * Higly sensitive data stored locally while web application runs on AWS
 * AWS provides tools so that they can talk to each other through AWS Direct Connect
 
 

############# Benefits of Cloud Computing
* High Availability:
// A high availability system is one that operates continuously without failure. Such systems avoid loss of service by managing failures.

Elasticity: 
//This is where you provision services based on demand. With this, you donâ€™t have to plan ahead of time.

Agility:
// AWS helps you innovate faster giving you speed.

Durability:
// This refers to data protection and AWS gives you long term data protection.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 * Cloud computing - on-demand delivery of compute power, database, storage, applications and other IT resources via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing


*********************Cloud Service Models**********************************

## PaaS (Platform as a Service)
 // A service that offers a complete development and deployment in the cloud. The customer manages the application and data on a platform while the service provider
   provides the runtime, middleware, virtualization, OS, servers, storage, networking. You only worry about deploying your app to the end user while evrything else is taken care of
 // Examples of PaaS; Gooogle Cloud Engine, Heroku, Elastic Beanstalk (AWS)
 
 ## SaaS (Software as a Service)
 // Is a way companies deliver applications or software over the internet to the end user.
 // Complete product
// Now with using a SaaS product, everything is already managed for you.
// You do not have to manage anything at all. The service provider manages everything from the application, the data, the runtime, 
   the middleware, the operating system,the virtualization, servers, storage, and networking.
   Examples: Zoom, MailChimp(email marketing service), Dropbox, Slack etc
   
   
## IaaS (Infrasctructure as a Service)
// A form of computing service that provides virtualized computing services over the internet to its users
   Virtualization uses software to create abstract layer over a computer hardwware
// More control over IT resources
// The user is responsible to run the Application, Data, Runtime, middleware, OS while the service provider manages virtualization, servers, storage and networking
// Examples: AWS, Microsoft Azure and GCP


## FaaS (function as a Service)
// A foem of cloud computing service that allows you to execute code in response to events
// The user only manages application while the rest is managed by service provider (Data to Network)
Wxample: Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions, AWS Lambda



#### Server
// A computer or device that provides programmable service to another computer program and its user
  
  Types of Servers
   Database servers
   App servers
   Web Servers
   
   
#### Serverless
// A cloud computing execution model in which the cloud provider allocates machine resources on demand


#### Cloud computing deployment models
  Cloud
  Hybrid
  On-Premises - dedicated reources


****************** Advantages of cloud computing
i) Trade capital expense for variable expense (COPEX)
   - Pay for what you consume
   - Data center investment based on forecast
ii) Benefits of massive economies of scale - resulting from severaal cloud services
iii) Stop guessing capacity
iv) increased speed and agility
v) Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers
vi) Go global in minutes
