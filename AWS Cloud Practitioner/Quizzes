Options available for reserved instances
// Reserved Instance - reserve an instance for one or three year term and in turn receive a significant discount compared to the on-demand instance

 * AURI (All Upfront Reserved Instance)
 * NURI (No Upfront Reserved Instance)
 * PURI (Partial Upfront Reserved Instance)
 
 
 // Amazon Cost Explorer gives you more details about Amazon EC2 billing that took place three months ago
 
 // Elasticity is the ability to acquire resources as you need them and release resources when you no longer need them. 
    Think of Auto Scaling and adding and removing instances as needed.
 
 // You're hosting a web application on EC2. After a few days of production usage, you notice the traffic to the web application far exceeds what was expected. 
    You've decided to move to a larger instance type. What AWS principle does this represent?
    * Vertical scaling - increasing the size and computing power of a single instance or node without increasing the number of nodes or instances.
    
    
 // A company is receiving automated alerts notifying them that their only production EC2 instance is continuously reaching 100% CPU utilization. 
    When this happens, customers cannot make purchases and receive error messages stating they should try again later because all the company's servers are busy.
    What should the company implement to ensure their system is highly available?
    * Horizontal scaling (scaling out) - adds or replaces EC2 instances automatically across AZs, based on need and changing demand, 
                                         and is used in the design of systems with high availability.
                                         
                                         
  // An Application Load Balancer automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple EC2 instances 
     based on application variables like content type, user location, and more. The company in this case only has 1 EC2 instance.
     
 
 // A customer has noticed several of their AWS accounts were hacked and used to mine bitcoin. Who should the customer report the issue to?
   * AWS Abuse Team
   
 // In order to improve fault tolerance, you would like to begin using services that provide fault tolerance. 
    Which AWS services provide automatic replication across Availability Zones?
   * DynamoDB
   
 // Trusted advisor - provides you with real-time guidance to help you provision your resources following AWS best practices.
                    -  can help you optimize your AWS environment by giving recommendations to reduce cost, increase performance, and improve security
 
 // A company wants to ensure all AWS accounts in their environment conform to company-wide policies. Which services can help?
   * Organizations - centrally manage AWS resources under one umbrella. You can allocate resources and apply policies across accounts
   * Control Tower -  helps you ensure your accounts conform to company-wide policies. Control Tower actually sits on top of Organizations.
   
 // Region - geographically area of the world that is a collection of logically grouped data centers (Availability Zones)
 
 // A company is developing a new web application that has high availability requirements. How can the company increase availability when deploying the application?
   * Deploy the application to span across multiple Availability Zones (AZs).
   * Utilize a multi-Region deployment when deploying the application.
   
   
// Your company would like to begin using Auto Scaling to add servers when CPU utilization reaches a certain threshold (e.g., 70%). 
   Which service can you use to trigger actions when CPU utilization crosses the threshold?
  * CloudWatch Alarms - to monitor CPU utilization and trigger further action. 
         Further action could be an Auto Scaling group adding another EC2 instance and/or using SNS to notify team members of the occurrence.
  * Simple Notification Service can be used with CloudWatch to notify team members when a CloudWatch event or alarm is triggered, 
    but SNS is not monitoring resource utilization.
    

// An on-premises application requires a consistent, high-speed connection to the AWS Cloud environment that is better than an internet-based connection. 
   Which AWS service can provide this connection?
   * Direct Connect - private (bypasses the public internet), dedicated physical network connection from your on-premises data center to AWS. 
                      Since the connection is private, it is extremely fast.
                      
// Elastic Load Balancing - evenly distribute incoming traffic across all their EC2 instances.

// A developer doesn't want to hardcode the database password in their application code when developing a new application. 
  Which service will help with accessing the password without having to hardcode it?
  * Secrets Manager allows you to manage and retrieve secrets (passwords or keys).
  
  
// A bucket access policy can be attached directly to an S3 bucket to limit access to specific users (secure Amazon S3 buckets)
